    <h2 class="subtitles background-color">Credit Where It's Due: A Tribute to the Contributions of Black People to the Fashion Industry</h2>
    <p class="intro">“Credit Where It’s Due” was a three-month-long project, created by a friend and me. For this project, we researched the impact and contributions of black models and designers to the fashion industry today. To represent our research, we then crocheted 23 pieces in total. Each piece was either a direct recreation or inspired by a movement the model/designers started or contributed significantly to. Our culminating presentation was a fashion show, where we had 15 models in our show. Watch the fashion show below :D I'm the first one on the right in the blue dress.

    <p class="intro">BeDazzled is an app I created using Swift at Kode With Klossy 2022. The app merges the idea of color theory as it relates to aesthetics. It offers functionality similar to Pinterest, but more personalized. After taking a quiz that determines their style aesthetic, users get outfit ideas based on their aesthetic 
      in order to style their own clothes and step up their outfits. Having a personal style has really helped me with my confidence. <b>Look good, feel good, do good!</b></p>

    <p class="intro"> For my final project in Kode with Klossy's Data Science curriculum at Kode with Klossy 2023, I worked with a group to create a data visualization for the school-to-prison pipeline.
       We worked in Google Colab and SQL to understand the purpose of finding good data, how to clean it, and how to organize it. We then organized our data in Google Sheets and used Looker Studio to 
       create data visualizations! I wanted to pursue this topic because it is not discussed nearly as much as it should be. I figured the best way to start calling attention to it is to inform people about it.
