        <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Ezinne and I'm an American-born Nigerian girl. I speak Igbo and English and have an older brother who I absolutely adore! I’m a senior in high school and passionate about computer science and racial advocacy:)

        <h2><a id = "whoAmI?"></a>Who Am I?</h2>
          <p>In my free time, I like to cook jollof rice, though eating plantain is just as fun. Staying connected to my culture is very important to me, so you might find me listening to afro beats. Some of my favorite songs are <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/track/18t2ofQiViidZHxOBVjpD1?si=916b016273ff46d5" target="_blank">“Koroba” by Tiwa Savage</a> and <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/track/7HhxQyDHGrtwqaR3QmH30N?si=13b41dc2420e4018" target="_blank">“Berna” by Flavour</a>. I also like to code (you’re looking at one of my projects right now!)

        <div>
          <p>I am passionate about bridging my interests in advocacy and computer science to make the world a better place:) Specifically, I believe that helping on a small scale is the first step to creating equitable opportunities. Upon reading So You Want to Talk About Race by Ijeoma Oluo, I took an interest in observing microaggressions, beauty standards, the school-to-prison pipeline, and more. I’m committed to combatting these issues by immersing myself in a thorough understanding and encouraging others to have difficult conversations surrounding how these issues affect them, negatively or positively.
          </p></div> 

        <div><p>Fun fact! I don’t like cheese but in a very specific way. I like pizza, but not cheeseburgers and nachos. I love Cheez-Its and Goldfish, but the extra cheddar versions are a definite no.  Living in California my whole life, I have never seen snow. Yes, I’m still shocked.

            <p>BeDazzled is an app I created in Swift in Kode With Klossy using Swift. The app merges the idea of color theory as it relates to aesthetics. Using Swift, it offers functionality similar to Pinterest, but more personalized. After taking a quiz that...</p>
